We want to remember or mark things when working or studying, so that we could recall and use them later, however we will look up massive things everyday, and as a result we may not have time to summarize or clean up them, it is a waste of time to repeate yourself to search it again.Thus we intend to build our knowledge system, it is valuable for you.

Knowledges have various types, for example, the basic, it means we have to master them before we go deeper, take another one, the tricky which you make you a big touble, and we want to mark them so as to avoid it in the future.

The knowledge system should be easy for user to find what he/she wants.
